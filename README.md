# Visualizations for Acquisition by Microsoft Corp.

First web consists of Microsoft's Company Acquisition history visualizations. I have taken data from Wikipedia.

Content: The attributes include the date, year, month of the acquisition, name of the company acquired, value or the cost of acquisition, business use-case of the acquisition, and the country from which the acquisition was made.
